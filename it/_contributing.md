Sass Guidelines is a free project that I maintain in my spare time. Needless to say, it is quite a large amount of work to keep everything up-to-date, documented and relevant. Obviously, knowing that you liked this styleguide is already much appreciated!

Now if you feel like contributing, please know that tweeting about it, spreading the word, or fixing a tiny typo by opening an issue or a pull-request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-guidelines) would be great!

Last but not least before we start: if you enjoyed this document, or if it is useful for you or your team, please consider supporting it!
